"""
Given a number n, write a program to find the sum of the 
largest prime factors of each of nine consecutive numbers 
starting from n.
g(n) = f(n) + f(n+1) + f(n+2) + f(n+3) + f(n+4) + f(n+5) + 
f(n+6) +f(n+7) + f(n+8)
where, g(n) is the sum and f(n) is the largest prime factor 
of n
For example,
g(10)=f(10)+f(11)+f(12)+f(13)+f(14)+f(15)+f(16)+f(17)+f(18)
