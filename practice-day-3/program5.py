A teacher is in the process of generating few reports based 
on the marks scored by the students of her class in a project 
based assessment.
Assume that the marks of her 10 students are available in a 
tuple. The marks are out of 25.
Write a python program to implement the following functions:
1.find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of 
students who have scored more than the average mark of the 
class.
2.generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the 
same marks. For example, how many have scored 0, how many have 
scored 1, how many have scored 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. 
The result should be populated in a list and returned.
3.sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 
0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a list and
 returned.
